An interactive two-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript. Click the dice to roll them, watch them animate, and see who wins!

## ✨ Features

- Click-to-roll functionality for each player
- Smooth rolling animation using `setInterval`
- Dynamic dice image updates
- Automated winner detection after both dice stop
- Clean UI interaction without external libraries

## 📁 File Structure

/project-root │ ├── index.html ├── style.css ├── script.js └── /images ├── dice1.png ├── dice2.png ├── dice3.png ├── dice4.png ├── dice5.png └── dice6.png


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure all `dice*.png` images are located in the `/images` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.
4. Click each dice image to roll.
5. A winner will be displayed at the top!

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each dice has its own rolling logic with a short animation cycle.
- After finishing, each result is stored and then compared.
- Once both dice have results, the `win()` function announces the outcome.

## 💡 Potential Enhancements

- Add sound effects or vibration feedback
- Track win/loss statistics
- Make it mobile-responsive
- Refactor repeated logic to improve DRYness
